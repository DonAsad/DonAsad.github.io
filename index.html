                " Talking about two of the technologies that Silicon Valley is most excited about right now -- cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence -- the controversial billionaire and PayPal cofounder used this technique on Wednesday night. "Crypto is libertarian, AI is communist,"<br> Thiel declared, during a public debate with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman at Stanford University's Hoover Institute."

                 What the heck was Peter Thiel talking about ? This statement seemingly astounded Reid Hoffman and earned a chuckle from the audience (anyone noticed how when Peter makes a joke he fidgets rather excitedly in his chair? anyone ? No ?). Reid offered a seemingly Beijing Communist party official like metaphor: AI is the "rule of law" and Cryptocurrencies are "anarchy". Reid a CCP party official ? Hmm a very nice conspirancy theory to explore.

                At its core, artificial intelligence is based on the monopoly of big data and information channels. Big institutions having quadriptes (for lack of a better word )  of data about each one of us. Big institutions knowing more about us than we know about ourselves, think Google, not suprising given that Sergey Brin is a Russian Communist and Google is a Communist gorvenment wet dream. Think of the huge massive datasets required to train AI algorithms and  machine learning neaural networks to do learn most basic of the tasks, e.g to recognise a cat, I need only to see a kangaroo once to know recognise it, I don't know about you, sorry if you are a google web crawler, will that affect my rankings Mr Crawler?.

                 Created by Satoshi Nakamoto blockchain is a distributed ledger system which allows information to be shared but not replicated accross a series of nodes. Blockchain removes the need for a middleman or a centralised owner making the technology virtualy impossible to hack, manipulate and censor. Blockchain is amazingly individualistic and libertarian. It maximises freedom and automony. To think of it Blockchain and Cryptos at their core emphasize individual judgemnt, voluntary association and freedom of choice.These are ideals the Chinesse gorvenment or more broadly Communism is against. Communism is all about sacrificing the individual for supposed good of the community. Here is more on how China leveraging AI to drive Big Brother AI driven authoritarian regimes <a href="www.ai.com">click here</a>

                 Take one word from my rant, individual judgemnt and connect that to this premise of hate speech in social networks. Who gets to decide what qualifies as hate speech and what does not ? Silicon Valley nerds get to decide all that, is the judgemnt even democratic, any set of defined rules they follow ? NO. Its all based on their biases because they are this huge centralised plartforms and so therefore they hold the reigns of censorship, deciding how society functions and heck its every Silicon Valley nerd wet dream to have such power at the supposed intention of removing hate speech. Euareka !! Understand now why so much Reid Hoffman is against Crypto..it takes away his wet dream of a lifetime and AI ? Well all the power to few individuals to regulate and control us. No gorvenment in the history of mankind has had such powers and we have given all of it to them. Reid Hoffman is not about to let it go that easily

               <p>
                 The more obvious choice is for entrepreuners to leverage the centralizing power of AI and the decentralizing power of Blockchain for public good. The more sort of technolodical answer to these concerns is: how can we do more with less data because that on its own is a viable differentiator among start ups as more and more people are becoming aware of how more and more respect for the individual is being eroded at the supposed intention of training AI algorithms that translate only to more  targeted ads.

                 This just a philosophical layout of what can be and should be done . If you are interested in the practical solutions to these problems posed by AI and these huge centralised plartforms knowing more about us that we know about ourselves I have prived the link here <a href="solutions.html">What should be done</a>
               </p>
               <p>
                 I know I sounded anti AI but I do love AI given that I am also involved in its development and follow keenly AI tech news but if we arent careful, before AI is intelligent enough to wipe out human beings, it will be leveraged and exploited by these huge corporations and gorvenments to take more and more rights from. I disagree most fiercely with Reid's premise that if you demand privacy then you have something to hide, that was a very stupid statemnt, privacy is fundamental human right. Doubt me?? Try seeeing how Mark Zuckerberg mantion is build to maximise his privacy. We need privacy, we demand privacy.
